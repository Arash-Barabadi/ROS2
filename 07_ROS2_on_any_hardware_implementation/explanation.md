## if the hardware (microcontroller) is different. If ros2 doesn't have ready to use interface to be implemented on your microcontroller. what we can do? 
## What if upgrade comes along and therefore breaks things. here user defined hardware interface comes into play.
## 
## please note that, the interface has to be written in C++. 
## Something else to be aware of is that it is still very much under active development. 
## So, while the concept in this tutorial will probably remain the same for a while, some of the actual code and details might change in the future. First of all, let's recap what a hardware interface does.

# What does a Hardware interface do?
## A hardware interface, or hardware component, is a plugin written in C++ for a specific hardware model that standardizes access to the hardware's functionality.
