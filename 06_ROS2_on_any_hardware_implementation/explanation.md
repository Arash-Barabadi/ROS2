## if the hardware (microcontroller) is different. If ros2 doesn't have ready to use interface to be implemented on your microcontroller. what we can do? 
## What if upgrade comes along and therefore breaks things. here user defined hardware interface comes into play.
## 
## please note that, the interface has to be written in C++. 
## Something else to be aware of is still very much under active developement. So while the concept in this tutorial will probably stay the same for a while, some of the actual code and details might change in future. First of all let's recap what a hardware interface does. 

# What does a Hardware interface do?
## A hardware interface or a hardware component is a plugin written in C++ for a specific model of hardware that exposes that hardware's functionality in a standard way.
