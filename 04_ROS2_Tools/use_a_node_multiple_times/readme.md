## For example, if you have a node for a temperature sensor and if you have 5 temperature sensors, then you'll want to launch a same node five times and of course with a different name for each sensor, because if you launch the same node with the same name more than 1 time, this can have unintended side effects. 
## The solution for that is to rename the same node, as many time as you need. we call it REMAPping
