## When we are using external packages, like "example_interfaces", we need to write our program dependency on them as follows:

### 1- package.xml
```xml
<note>
  <to>User</to>
  <from>ChatGPT</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget to include XML code in your README.md</body>
</note>

```
### 2- CMakeLists.txt
