#
## We will create a service server in python that will take two numbers as a request and return the sum as a response.
## So let's use the service definition here and in the above folder we created our own service definition. 
```bash
arash@arash-HP-ZBook-15-G2:~/ros2_ws/src/my_py_pkg/my_py_pkg$ touch add_two_ints_server.py
```
## then we make it executable
```bash
arash@arash-HP-ZBook-15-G2:~/ros2_ws/src/my_py_pkg/my_py_pkg$ chmod +x add_two_ints_server.py 
```
